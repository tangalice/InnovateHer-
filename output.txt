Tampax

* Beneficial Ingredients: Tampax tampons contain a small amount of cotton, which can help with absorbency, but it's worth noting that the majority of the product is made from rayon, a semi-synthetic material.
 
* Harmful Ingredients: Tampax tampons may contain dioxins, a byproduct of the bleaching process, and fragrances, which can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some individuals.

* Potential Side Effects: Using Tampax tampons can lead to potential side effects such as toxic shock syndrome, vaginal irritation, and allergic reactions, although these are relatively rare.

* Safer Alternatives: Safer alternatives to Tampax tampons include organic cotton tampons, menstrual cups, and period underwear, which are made from natural materials and can reduce the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals.

* Ranking: Ranking: 3, as while Tampax tampons are generally considered safe to use, the potential presence of dioxins and fragrances, as well as the risk of toxic shock syndrome, mean that they may not be the safest option for all users.
